Machine Learning models for profit predication.
The profit earned by a company for a particular period depends on several factors like how
much R&D Spend, Administration Cost and Marketing Spend. So, for predicting the profit of
a company for a particular period we need to train a machine learning model with a dataset
that contains historical data about the profit generated by the company of 50 Companies.
So, we have used five different machine learning algorithms to predict the profit. Out of five
model Linear Regression model is best fit from the models such as Linear Regression,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, Polynomial Regression, Artificial Neural Network
